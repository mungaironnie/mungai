<h1>The Extremist</h1>
<p>I’ve recently picked up the addictive habit of solitude. It's in these times I begin to realize that most of us(especially me) don’t go the whole way. We don’t give all that there is to give. We hesitate. We cower. I cant speak for most, but for me, it hurts like a mofo to be conscious of this reality. Only recently did I begin to fix this problem- I’ve become an extremist.</p>
<p>David Senra’s Founders podcast is the greatest influence in this stage of my life. His infectious passion seeps through the speakers, and his deep knowledge on the histories greatest founders drives my long-term strategies and short-term tactics.</p>
<p>Not once in any episode has he preached the concept of balance. Those who have won in the past were relentless, they were extreme in every sector of their life. And I, a fool, once thought I could maintain a balance of ruthless pursuit and conventional enjoyment.</p>
