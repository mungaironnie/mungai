    <p>My decision to start publishing my interests and understanding of the world at 17yo is not an act of ego or brashness. I am no better than anyone. Instead, this serves as a means of improving my writing and documenting my pursuit of self-improvement. Additionally, should the dedication to my work pay off, I hope to inspire others courageous enough to chase their ambition. </p>
