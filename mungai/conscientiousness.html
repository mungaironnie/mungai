    <h1>Conscientiousness</h1>
    <p>Admittedly, the complex equation of success is something I frequently ruminate about.  Studying othersâ€™ success seems to only make the uncertainty-caused anxiety grow. Of course, Jobs stumbled across Wozniak, a genius engineer at the genesis of modern computers, of course a technology called the internet was growing at 2300% when Bezos started Amazon. Fate seems to transmute to align itself to benefit these great founders. But is that the reason for their success? Is all it takes to build the most valuable companies in the world just luck? </p>
    <p>No. Not by the stretch of the imagination. However, some variables seem to always find a place in the equation of their success, especially conscientiousness.</p>
    <p>Conscientiousness is often coupled with purpose. A deep, abiding conviction that you are moving towards something great, something worth sacrificing the present for.</p>
    <p>An indisputable trait, so necessary for high performance.</p>
