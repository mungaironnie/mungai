    <h2>Ruthlessly Protect your self-belief</h2>
    <p>As a high schooler, I've spent countless hours isolated in a dimly lit room, the only illumination being the cold, unwavering glow of my computer screen.  studying the lives of history's greatest individuals in their respective fields, letting their achievements light my path.
    </p>
    <p>Alexander the Great, Tiger Woods, Jeff Bezos, Leonardo da Vinci, etc 
    </p>
    <p>Despite being so different with many contradicting beliefs, one character trait never fails to burn in the hearts of those who change the world.
    </p>
    <p>Self-belief. 
    </p>
    <p>Napoleon wielded this weapon against the British forces during the Siege of Toulon, leading the attack at great personal risk. His horse was shot from under him, he suffered a stab in his thigh, and he even manned the cannons himself after a soldier was shot.
    </p>
    <p>Only a commander with such great self-belief could inspire a disadvantaged army to victory. And for his triumph, he is made a general. At the young age of 24.
    </p>
    <p>That being said, I ought to project by self-belief at any cost. 
    </p>
    <p>Guard it against the world's efforts to level the playing field, from those who find delight in derailing others, from misleading data that attempts to tuck my mind in the warm bed of societal expectations.
    </p>
    <p>To project the fire in my heart because if I lose that, I have nothing.
